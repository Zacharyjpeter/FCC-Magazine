A simple magazine. I learned CSS Grid by building this project.
<br>
<h3>Challenges</h3>
This project took longer than expected to finish. CSS Grid is an important and complex topic. My biggest challenge was understanding the syntax for each property and not rushing through. Specifically when using grid-template-rows v columns, I had trouble understanding what the numbers were selecting.
<br>
<h3>Takeaways</h3>
Grid is an important concept. I need more practice before it really sinks in.
